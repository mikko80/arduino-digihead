# arduino-digihead
Head unit for display of Digijet/Digifant ECU signals captured with arduino-digicap project

## Development Setup

Workflow is based around PlatformIO.

On a Mac, use `homebrew` to install PlatformIO.

I use IntelliJ CLion IDE. The integration with PlatformIO is decent, and seems to be getting better.
